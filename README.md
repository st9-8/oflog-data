# Academic project: Experiments for a research paper

The goal is to build a Question Answering System on logs data based on Sequence Tagging task using Conditional Random
Fields with RDF Graphs.

This repo provides a codebase for data transformation of those [data](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset) to
entry data for the proposal architecture hosted at [oflog-qa](https://github.com/st9-8/oflog-qa).
